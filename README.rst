Installation
==============

The easiest way to install the devise repo is from PyPi:

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install devise

Alternatively, you may clone this repo and install it:

.. code-block:: text

    $ git clone https://github.com/devisechain/Devise
    $ cd Devise/python
    $ pip install .


For more detailed installation instructions, and for information on platform specific system dependencies, please consult our `Installation Guide <https://github.com/devisechain/Devise/wiki/8.-Installation-Guide>`_

How To Create A Client
======================

The repo connects to the Ethereum network through a public Ethereum node.


For signing Ethereum transactions and requests to our cryptographic API, we support the `Official Ethereum Wallet`_, hardware wallets (`Ledger Nano S`_ and Trezor_ to be specific), encrypted keystore files, and clear private keys.


All Devise-related operations can be performed through the :code:`DeviseClient` class.

To use the `Official Ethereum Wallet`_, run

.. code-block:: python

    from devise import DeviseClient
    # Create a Devise client object to interact with our smart contracts and API.
    devise_client = DeviseClient(account='0xd4a6B94E45B8c0185...', password='<your password>')


To use a hardware wallet, run

.. code-block:: python

    from devise import DeviseClient
    # Create a Devise client object to interact with our smart contracts and API.
    devise_client = DeviseClient(account='0xd4a6B94E45B8c0185...', auth_type='[ledger|trezor]')


To use a keystore file, run

.. code-block:: python

    from devise import DeviseClient
    # Create a Devise client object to interact with our smart contracts and API.
    devise_client = DeviseClient(key_file='<path to your encrypted json keystore file>', password='<your password>')


To use a clear private key, run

.. code-block:: python

    from devise import DeviseClient
    # Create a Devise client object to interact with our smart contracts and API.
    devise_client = DeviseClient(private_key='<your private key>')


The :code:`password` argument is always optional. When it is needed for signing but not provided, you will be prompted to type it in every time a transaction needs to be signed.

If needed, you can override the public node used to connect to the Ethereum network by specifying a :code:`node_url` when creating your :code:`DeviseClient` instance.


How To Access The Devise Blockchain
===================================

In order to access the Devise blockchain, you need to i) have enough DVZ tokens, ii) fund your escrow account with us in DVZ, iii) submit a bid, and iv) request data from the API if your bid is successful.


Our initial token sale requires all buyers (investment managers) to undergo KYC. Only whitelisted addresses can buy Devise tokens. To be whitelisted, send us an email at devise_beta@pit.ai. Once you've been whitelisted, here are a few ways of buying DVZ tokens:

.. code-block:: python

    # Example 1: Buy 1,500,000 DVZ tokens
    status = devise_client.buy_tokens(1500000)

    # Example 2: Buy 150 ethers worth of DVZ tokens
    status = devise_client.buy_eth_worth_of_tokens(150)

    # Example 3: Buy 75,000 USD worth of DVZ tokens
    # The ETH/USD rate is retrieved from GDAX to infer the ETH equivalent of your
    # USD amount, which you need to have in your wallet as we only accept ETH.
    status = devise_client.buy_usd_worth_of_tokens(75000)


To transfer 1,000,000 DVZ tokens from your wallet to your escrow account with us, run

.. code-block:: python

    # Record your current wallet DVZ balance
    dvz_balance = devise_client.dvz_balance

    # Provision your escrow account
    status = devise_client.provision(1000000)

    # Check that your tokens made it
    assert devise_client.dvz_balance_escrow >= 1000000

    # Check that your wallet balance has dropped by 1,000,000
    assert devise_client.dvz_balance == dvz_balance-1000000


If needed, you can request historical data to assess value-add:

.. code-block:: python

    # Note: Historical data are free of charge, but your escrow account
    # must be sufficiently provisioned to pay one month rent to be allowed
    # access historical data.

    # Check if you are currently allowed to request historical data.
    has_access = devise_client.client_summary['historical_data_access']
    print(has_access)

    # Download historical weights of all leptons on the devise
    # blockchain and store them in the file 'devise_historical_weights.tar'
    # in the current folder.
    devise_client.download_historical_weights()

    # Download historical returns of all leptons on the devise
    # blockchain and store them in the file 'devise_historical_returns.tar'
    # in the current folder.
    devise_client.download_historical_returns()

Once you know how many seats you want to bid for, and at what price, you can submit your bid by running

.. code-block:: python

    # Example: submit a bid for 10 seats on the devise blockchain, for a monthly rent capped at 200,000 DVZ.
    seats = 10
    # Note: The limit monthly rent per seat below is indicative.
    lmt_monthly_rent_per_seat = 200000
    # The limit price the auction abides by is the limit price per bit of total incremental usefulness.
    # If between terms leptons are added to the chain, the total incremental usefulness might change,
    # and as a result you might be paying a higher rent. Your rent per seat and per unit of total
    # incremental usefulness will however never exceed your specified limit price per bit.
    lmt_price = lmt_monthly_rent_per_seat/devise_client.total_incremental_usefulness
    devise_client.lease_all(lmt_price, seats)


To check if you won seats in the current term, run

.. code-block:: python

    # Check how many seats you have access to in the current term.
    total_seats = devise_client.current_term_seats
    has_seats = total_seats > 0
    print(has_seats)

If you are entitled seats, you can request portfolio weights updates by running

.. code-block:: python

    # Download latests weights of all leptons on the devise blockchain
    # and stores them in the file 'devise_latest_weights_<yyyy-mm-dd>.tar'
    # in the current folder. Data updates are available on a daily basis before 7AM ET.
    latest_weights = devise_client.download_latest_weights()
